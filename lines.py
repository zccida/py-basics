'''
Even so, in a file called lines.py, implement a program that expects exactly one command-line argument,
the name (or path) of a Python file, and outputs the number of lines of code in that file,
excluding comments and blank lines. If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument,
or if the specified fileâ€™s name does not end in .py, or if the specified file does not exist, the program should instead exit via sys.exit.
