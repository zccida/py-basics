# Prompts the user for a level, If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program should prompt again.


#Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = , wherein each of X and Y is a non-negative integer with N
# digits. No need to support operations other than addition (+).

# Prompts the user to solve each of those problems.
# If an answer is not correct (or not even a number), the program should output EEE and prompt the user again,
# allowing the user up to three tries in total for that problem. If the user has still not answered correctly after three tries,
# the program should output the correct answer.
# The program should ultimately output the userâ€™s score: the number of correct answers out of 10.
